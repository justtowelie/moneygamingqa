I've observed that there seems to be an issue with sheets not loading on the page within a timely manner, its taking 40-50 seconds to load the sheets before executing and occasionally failing with the below error.
"Timed out after waiting 60000ms for your remote page to load" ... "Browsers will not fire the load even until all stylesheets and scripts are done downloading" 

I've been advised that this a known issue and is being looked into for resolution.
